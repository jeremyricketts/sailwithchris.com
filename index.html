			<p>I have not had this much sailing in years! I forgot how fun and carefree day sailing can be. The trade winds are pretty consistent and there is no swell other than a little wind chop. We bounce from anchorage to anchorage depending on the weather conditions, diving, hiking, and exploring everywhere we go. We want to stay here forever!</p>

			<p>Approaching Neiafu in the Vava’u group of Tonga is very straight forward. This seems to be the first place most cruising boats decide to check in before they explore the rest of the Tongan islands, so the main harbor of Neiafu is well charted and marked. Approaching from the north east of the main island, the only real hazard to worry about is yup, you guessed it, an <span class="caps">FAD</span>. I did spot the one about 5 miles north of the light tower, and though I did not check my <span class="caps">GPS</span> at the time, the coordinates of, 18deg32.7S-174deg04.2W, seemed very accurate. Once in the lee of Vava’u near the light tower entrace, the islands are not quite high enough to completely block the trade winds, so sailing all the way to the main harbor is possible if you so decide. We sailed most of the way in to the lighted range markers, and I think you will want to also when you quickly remember how fun it is sailing at hull speed through all these beautiful islands in lake like conditions. Once in sight of the first range markers a heading of 65.5 degrees true will bring you in safely past the two green can buoys off to your starboard side. I mainly use my eyeballs, but if you use CM93 charts in coordination with a <span class="caps">GPS</span> unit, it has been reported to be quite a bit off. There is one discrepancy I found on the CM93 charts. After the first green can buoy, the electronic charts say that the buoy marking shoal water off to your starboard side is black, but it is instead green. There are also two red can buoys off to your port as well that are not stated on the CM93 charts while on the entrance bearing. There is a second set of range markers after you round the second green buoy, but they will be astern as they are the exit bearings for leaving the harbor. The chart says 291 degrees true, but the correct bearing upon entering will be 111 degrees true, once you glance behind you and line them up astern. If you’re like me you will surprised at how many boats are moored in the harbor. There are plenty of moorings available from many of the private companies located in Neiafu, many of which monitor channel 16. Be aware though, you will at some point have to dock your boat on one of the two wharfs for the authorities to board your boat and check you in, so you may want to take care of that first and then worry about where to settle in. There are a few anchorages inside Neiafu, but we decided to go around the corner and anchor in the lee of Kafoa which is anchorage #4 on the Moorings map that you can purchase from the Moorings company above the Aquarium cafe, and it was extremely protected.<br />
Formalities:<br />
It can get quite a bit busy as they have a few boats checking in/out daily. There are two main docks to tie up to at the wharf. One is much bigger than the other with permanent black fenders, but for boats with lower free board your best bet is probably the smaller one. There are four separate officials who will board your boat and ask you to fill out the normal clearance papers. They really only come aboard to have you fill out the necessary paper work and chat a bit, and at no point did they do a thorough search of the vessel and start digging around the boat for vegetables, produce and the like. The process can take a few hours especially if you get there between 12:30 and 1:30 as this is their lunch hour. Health is $100 Pa’anga(about $55 US), Quarantine is $30 Pa’anga, and a 30 day visa is free for the first 30 days. After that, it is $69 Pa’anga a month per person.</p>

			<p>We are leaving Niue in our wake and heading west for Tonga! It looks as though we&#8217;ll have great 15-20 knots of winds out of the SE so the 2-3 day trip to the Vava&#8217;u group should be great! Tonga will be our home base for about two months, so we look forward to settling in and exploring all that this magical island chain has to offer!</p>

			<p>All around Niue has been our favorite stop yet. The water visibility is the best we have ever seen. The island is extremely bike friendly, including the courtesy of the vehicles to bikes as well. The locals are extremely friendly. The boaters have private showers at the dock with hot water and the fresh water is safe for drinking. Every inch of the island is loaded with caves, arches, tidal beaches, hikes, and bike tracks. Beer isn&#8217;t cheap, but you won&#8217;t have much time to drink with so many things to explore anyway. Niue is a gem of the Pacific</p>

			<p>We finally broke out our little single speed folding bikes, and I’m so glad we did, biking here is awesome! There are rental companies that rent bikes by the day so don’t worry if you’re not lugging around your own ride. A lot of the roads are paved that go around the entire island and there are some great dirt trails(bike tracks)as well, that are all well marked and numbered on the main map from the visitors center. Pretty much anywhere on the island is accessible with two wheels!</p>

			<p>Most all the other restaurants and stores are closed on Sundays, so this is the place to be. The bar is a self service and on the honor policy. The burger is New Zealand style with an egg and sliced red beets, and is quite good. Most of the cruisers mingle here Sunday for sunset cocktails. Make sure and bring your snorkeling gear as Avatele Bay is some of the best on the island. There are dozens of great swim throughs, sea arches, and coral trenches. Snake alley, which is a dive spot for divers, is a short swim to the south as well.</p>

			<p>Fresh vegetables!!! Just follow the road south past Washaway Café and you’ll go up a steep hill and it’s located on the left. You can’t miss the rows of vegetables and the tomato green house. Brandon is the owner and operator and now does so full time because of the high demand for fresh produce from the few hotel/resorts on the island. His prices are much better than the local market near the wharf and if you like fresh herbs, he might let you help him weed his herb garden for free! He grows green leaf lettuce, red leaf lettuce, green cabbage, red cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes, purple basil, green basil, cilantro, mint, green onions, and papayas. Brandon is a super nice guy and I think he likes sharing his hobby with other people who appreciate fresh food. A stop here is a must in my book.</p>

			<p>Vaikona chasm/underwater caves: This place was the highlight of our trip. On the map from the visitors center it says that this hike is guided only, but we and a few other cruisers decided to go anyway. The trail is well marked and is pretty easy until you get near the water’s edge. You will then see an old sign that says, “Vaikona chasm: Falling rocks cave unsafe.” <span class="caps">PERFECT</span>!!! There are sturdy ropes set up that descend into the chasm, but we brought a 50 foot line as backup just to be safe. The boulders are extremely slippery deeper in the chasm as you descend so wear some good kicks with traction. There is a challenging bit descending down one boulder and committing to let go of the rope and shift your weight onto a lower one over a drop off, but the crisp, electric blue of the chasms fresh water pond once at the bottom is so worth it! When the afternoon sun beams through the large rift at the surface, bathing in the pool is absolutely amazing! If you’re a bit more daring, and you have a good underwater torch, there is a maze of underwater caves that start at the far end of the pool. We made our way as deep as we could into five different caves, some only a few feet above the surface. The best of them all is swimming back under the first arch on the return back to the chasm, the sunlight dances on the surface and gets brighter and brighter until you finally reach the surface.</p>

			<p>Niue(‘new-ay’) is one of the smallest nations in the Pacific. It is unlike most other Pacific islands in that it was thrust up and out of the ocean long ago and is now a completely ‘raised’ coral island. The abundance of underwater coral, lack of sand, and the sudden drop off into deep water surrounding Niue makes anchoring extremely difficult. The approach to Niue is pretty straight forward. There are no real hazards to worry about other than some FAD’s(that are unlit) put in by the local fisherman. There are many around the entire island, and some close to Alofi, but none seem to be more than a mile or so offshore. The chart has an entrance bearing of 123degrees true into Alofi, but this can be altered as long as you steer clear of the outlying reefs and fishing buoys. Once in sight of the Alofi wharf, the mooring field is to the south. The mooring balls are bright orange and have reflective tape if you decide to make landfall by night. The Niue Yacht Club, which might be the best little yacht club in the world, has about 20 regularly maintained moorings in Alofi. Most of the moorings are two 1 ton concrete blocks chained together and all the gear attached to the blocks are proper mooring shackles, pendants, and oversized three strand nylon line. The fee is $15 NZ(about $13US) a night and for every 6 days, the 7th is free. There are two wash rooms and showers with pressure hot and cold water a short walk up the dock and the yacht club in town has a book library, plenty of large chart tables, <span class="caps">FREE</span> internet, and cold beer and wine! All this for only $78US a week, and you’re backyard has some of the best diving and hiking in the world! </p>

	<p>Formalities:<br />
Both the yacht club and Niue radio station monitor channel 16. Once in radio range you can radio ahead to the yacht club to see if there are any available moorings. August, September and October are Niue’s busy months, and with all the puddle jumpers making their way west, there may be a chance they are full. There is a large mooring always left open for the cargo ship from New Zealand, and the yacht club allowed a boat to use that mooring until one of the regular ones was clear, so there are some options if the mooring field is full. Let Niue station know your <span class="caps">ETA</span> of arrival as well, and notify them when you have tied up securely to a mooring. They will then set up a time for you to meet with the customs officials on the wharf. When taking your skiff to the wharf you’ll notice that no boats are left side tied to the wall, and if you do you will cause yourself, the rest of the anchorage, and the local fisherman a lot of grief. There is a crane on the south side and you are required to hoist your skiff out of the water every time you come and go. The crane will lift small fishing boats and there is a dinghy dolly, so moving even the largest of cruising skiffs is not a problem. Make sure to give way to any locals coming in and out of the water first and always swing the crane arm back over the water for the next person. Keith from the yacht club will most likely meet you at the dock and show you around after you meet with customs. Leave any trash on your boat for a later day as they will try to stick you with a trash collecting fee for the first day. Once clear with customs walk up the road from the wharf and turn right to the police station with your passport. You’ll get your stamp and a fee of $34NZ per person is paid upon departure. Now it’s off to the yacht club, which is south of the police station below the backpackers hostel, for a cold beer!</p>

			<p>We made it! Our north east wind didn&#8217;t last long, so we had to throw in a few tacks to make some easting, but hey, I&#8217;m no gentleman so sailing upwind is fine with me! We will probably stay a few weeks before making our way west to Tonga.</p>

			<p>Our original plan was to head 150 miles SW to Niuatobutabu, but after a second look at the weather, it looks as though we might get a bit of north east winds starting today, so we will try and make some easting to Niue instead! Niue has no real anchorage, only the west side of the island blocking the prevailing trades. Because of the sudden drop off into deep water from the coastline, anchoring is nearly impossible, but there are a number of regularly maintained moorings that are available for a nominal fee. We are looking forward to getting underway again, and getting some salt water back in our veins!</p>

			<p>Another day hike! This hike is only for the adventurous. Take the bus towards Leone and tell the driver you would like to go to Pava’ia’i. Once off the bus, wait for a bus going up the hill A’oloaufou or just hitch, which worked fine for us. At the top of the hill keep your eye out for a big church with a grass area out front. There is a small, paved road off the right that works its way down towards the trail head. You will pass a big piece of property with cattle and pigs and then make your way up a small hill where there are two houses and a sign that says &#8216;<span class="caps">PRIVATE</span> <span class="caps">PROPERTY</span>&#8217; Beware the first house has aggressive dogs, even the little lap dog. Having your bag ready to swing and a rock ready to throw is not a bad idea. Yelling &#8216;<span class="caps">ALU</span>!&#8217;, which means go away in Samoan, seams to work fine, but just be prepared. At the last house, ask for permission to pass and tell them that you want to go down to massacre bay. They are very friendly and bringing them back a few papayas is not a bad idea. the trail is single track and bush, and if it rains, which it most likely will, it will be nice and muddy! It is a 2.5m hike to the beach. The last part of the trail is very steep, so grabbing a downed tree branch for a walking stick helps a lot. the trail then opens up to a fruit and vegetable patch and over a little fresh water river and into the sand. An extremely nice couple, Jim and Maria, are full time residents and have been for two and a half years. They are the only people who live in Massacre Bay, as the last family to leave was some time after the tsunami. Jim is very knowledgeable about the history of the bay and will give you a great tour. They invited us to stay for dinner, but since we had to get back to the top of the trail to catch a bus before night fall, Maria made us a dinner to go of lobster and steamed green bananas! The last bus going down the hill leaves around 4 o&#8217;clock so make sure and give yourself enough time to hike out. We visited with Jim and Maria for too long and missed the last bus, but hitching back down was not a problem. Exploring the more remote areas in American Samoa is well worth it. So many sailors drop the hook in Pago Pago, grab a big mac, pick up their parts at the post office, and then sail out a few days later and make a broad generalization that the whole island is extremely dirty. Get off the beaten path here, and the people, their families, and the land is really very beautiful.</p>

			<p>We took a break from working on the boat today and went on a day hike at Fagatele Bay. Leaving from the Pago anchorage you can jump on a Leone bus and let the driver know you want to go to go to the US mart. There is a street that heads down toward the water just before the US mart, so just start walking. There is trash everywhere on this road as there is a dump site not to far down, but I assure you once you reach the trail head it is worth it. The road comes to a gate and there is a house with a large yard with a tree in the center. Ask them for permission to use the trails and they will have you sign a piece of paper with your name and where you are from. Once on the trail head, it is a night and day difference from the anchorage. Getting a copy of the national park trail map from the visitors center is not a bad idea either. The visitor’s center is located across from the filling station on the south side of the anchorage. There are a few trails to choose from. The trail down to Fagatele bay is well maintained and is a very easy in and out hike. There are stairs at the end of the trail which lead down to the sand. Keep your eye out for buoys and floats washed up on the beach, I found a few and brought them back to the boat. If it has rained a few days prior, there will be some nice fresh water showers against the huge mossy rocks. The bay is a marine preserve so the wildlife and snorkeling is great.</p>

			<p>Take the Tafuna bus to the round-a-about just passed McDonalds then take the right off the main road and go two blocks. Go passed industrial gas and there will be a quonset hut on the right that says motorcycle shop. The shop is mainly used for motorcycle repair but just pop in and talk to Tony, the guy covered in metal shavings and oil, and he’ll gladly help you. He has hydraulic presses, drill presses, lathes, grinders, torches, welders, pretty much anything you would need minus a <span class="caps">CNC</span> machine. Tony is a no gloves, no goggles type of guy, so he’ll get done what you need no problem. The owner will negotiate a price with and will most likely ask you if you are on a yacht. I’m not sure if the price reflects whether you are on a boat or not, but I was happy with the work done and they won’t charge you a full hour for twenty minutes of work.</p>

			<p>We woke up this morning to the whole dock lined with trucks. Everyone was waiting for a cargo ship coming in and we were tied up right in front of the loading ramp. Running around in our skivvies was fun as everyone watched us shove off the dock. Luckily we measured and cut all the other shrouds the night before so the rest of the work can be done at anchor.</p>

			<p>We are tied up to the inter-island ferry dock which is located next to the marine police station. The concrete dock has huge rubber fenders, so if you&#8217;re worried about your gel coat, <span class="caps">BYO</span> fenders and lots of them. The area is huge and flat which is perfect for rigging work. The head stay came down no problem, but the trick was how to get the new wire rope to feed through the roller furling foil pieces. If you have any kind of roller furling head sail on your boat, it is probably like mine, and the foil pieces are aluminum and all the set screws used to attach these foil pieces together are stainless. My ProFurl unit is pretty old so these set screws were not coming out even after using penetrating lube and heat. A much easier way is to make sure to leave the old wire in and carefully epoxy the new wire to the old, making sure to keep a similar diameter. Once the epoxy is nice and set the next day, just pull on the old wire and bada bing, you now have a perfectly fed new wire in your foil! The new Sta-Lok fittings are a breeze to use, though the new packaging does not have detailed instructions on specific torque, etc. there are plenty of videos on you tube going through the process in detail. Reusing the fittings that were already on the boat is another story. Most riggers will tell you that bedding these type of swedge fittings with 3M 5200 is a must. I don&#8217;t know how many of these riggers have ever reused these fittings before, which the manufacture says is fine, but 5200 is great for bulkheads, thru hull joints, hull damage, but in my humble opinion,it has no place inside of a swedge fitting. Any type of silicon or less permanent adhesive like 3M 4000 will keep the water out just fine. It took a whole day just to clean out the old 5200 from the fittings. Soaking them in turpentine or mineral spirits overnight will make the process go a lot faster</p>

			<p>We take taco Tuesday pretty seriously here on the privateer, so discovering that Evalanie&#8217;s serves dollar tacos and it&#8217;s only steps away from the boat was a big deal. Take the road towards the back of the anchorage, it&#8217;s on your left had side, you can&#8217;t miss it. The tacos are hard shelled and though you have a choice of ground beef, pork, or fish, they are usually out of everything but ground beef. The bar is usually pretty empty but if you bring your own party, they play a great mix of loud hip hop and dance dance music. Remember the tacos are only a buck, I&#8217;m not talking about Zagat&#8217;s survey here.</p>

			<p>Thanks to mission control, aka my mom and her boyfriend Glen, All the rigging fittings and wire rope arrived safely at the post office! Carrying 200ft of wire rigging and all the fittings back to the boat was no easy task, but it was worth it because it felt like Christmas morning opening everything up. the port captain was nice enough to let us use the inter-island ferry dock for a few days while the boat is away in Western Samoa, so we have will ample room to drop the head stay foil, and measure and cut all the upper shrouds.</p>

			<p>Pago Pago(pronounced, “Pang-go Pang-go”) is located on the island of Tutuila, American Somoa’s largest island. Approaching Pago from the north east you are advised to keep a look out for FAD’s and fishing rafts, most of which are stated on the charts to be unlit. My chart, dated from the 1960’s, had two FAD’s and two rafts, but I later looked at another cruisers chart which was from the 1980’s and a few of the rafts and FAD’s were crossed off, and it looked to be an original marking on the chart itself. Pretty much what I’m saying, is I have no clue where these things are, if they are regularly maintained, or if they even exist at all, so use caution.</p>

	<p>The entrance to Pago is very straight forward as this is a heavily traveled, commercial shipping port. I slowed down the day before arriving to Pago, so as to make landfall during the day, but after seeing how well lit the bouys are, how wide the entrance is, and that there are lighted range markers, I would make this port in darkness with no hesitation. You are required to notify the Port Captain of your arrival on ch. 16, though I was unsuccessful upon my arrival and was helped out by a woman named Judy on ‘Windrider’, and she explained which formalities I needed to take care of and where to go. She actually has a sheet printed out on the basic formalities and some local info on the town itself which she hands out to cruisers whenever she can and it was pretty helpful. Anchoring here is not nearly as bad as all the horror stories I have read about. It did take a few failed attempts at getting the hook set, but once she was in she didn’t move an inch. There are several ‘bumps’ scattered around the anchorage, one of which is to the SW of the big, orange quarantine mooring. These bumps are much shallower than the rest of the anchorage which averages 35 feet. I dropped the hook on a 20 foot bump and had much better luck with holding power. It was either luck or maybe that not as much debris has settled on these bumps, which gives your hook a better opportunity at settling into the muddy ground, but either way it gives your anchor scope a better advantage. Once you’re all settled, you can take your skiff to the floating docks in front of McDonald’s or there is a very small, rocky beach with a nice tree trunk to tie up to right next to the gas station on the south side. This is a much closer option if you are like me and only have a rowing dinghy. Make sure to tie up good because high tide will float your dinghy unless you bring it up onto the grass.</p>

	<p>Formalities: First you have to check in with the Port Captain, Salila. His office is located on top of the harbor facility building which if you head east from McDonald’s it will be on your left hand side where all the big containers are stacked on top of each other. The guards at the entrance gate will tell you where his office is. Then it’s off to customs, which is in the same building on the first floor. After checking in with both the port captain and customs you have to walk a bit farther to reach the immigration office. Go back out to the gate and turn left. You will pass Sadie’s by the sea restaurant, which has happy hour daily, from 4-6 p.m. The burger there is excellent and it’s one of the few restaurants that serve the local beer, Vailima on draft. You’ll then pass the high school on your right side and then the Bank of Hawaii. Turn right into the driveway after the B of H and there will be a brown government building behind it. Immigration is on the first floor, and the AC in the office feels SO good! Now you’re checked in. The fee is $170 US for the boat, once you leave.</p>

			<p>We made it to America! Well, American Samoa that is. The crossing from Fanning was excellent. The trade winds were very light, which made for a slow crossing of 13 days, but it couldn&#8217;t have worked out better for the repair made to the head stay. Work on the rigging will commence soon, but first we are going to celebrate the 4th with <span class="caps">BBQ</span>&#8217;d dogs and cheap budweizers!</p>
